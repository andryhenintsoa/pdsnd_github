##Exploring US Bikeshare data
Use Python to understand U.S. bikeshare data.  Calculate statistics and build an interactive environment where a user chooses the data and filter for a dataset to analyze.

###Overview
In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
